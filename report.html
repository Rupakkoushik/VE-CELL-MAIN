            life. It involved
            intense exploration where students discussed their life issues, and the facilitators guided them to work
            on
            the root problems rather than providing ready-made solutions. The day started with an introduction to
            the
            workshop's topics and key checkpoints to be maintained throughout. Facilitators, including Dr. Akhilesh
            Verma, Dr. Parul Verma, and Dr. B.N Pandey, familiarized the participants with basic ideas of
            consciousness
